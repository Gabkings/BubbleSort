# Bubble-Sort

## Project Description

This project involves creating methods to sort a group of items in an array by using the bubble sort techniques. A method was created to sort integers and another one to sort strings when block is given.

## How it was Implemented

A method was created to accept an array of items in which each element is compared to the one next to it and they are swapped if the one on the left is larger than the one on the right. This continues until the array is eventually sorted.

## Built With

* RUBY
* VSCode

## Complexity of Bubble sort
Bubble sort has a worst-case and average complexity of Ðž(n2), where n is the number of items being sorted.
